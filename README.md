# GBIF Integrated Publishing Toolkit (IPT)

The Integrated Publishing Toolkit (IPT) is a free, open source software tool written in Java that is used to publish and share biodiversity datasets through the GBIF network. The IPT can also be configured with a DataCite account in order to assign DOIs to datasets transforming it into a data repository.

Here you can find the IPT source code, [IPT User Manual](https://ipt.gbif.org/manual/) source code, and the [IPT issue tracker](https://github.com/gbif/ipt/issues).

Most users should look at the [IPT website](https://www.gbif.org/ipt) and [user manual](https://ipt.gbif.org/manual/), and send any questions to the [IPT Mailing List](https://lists.gbif.org/mailman/listinfo/ipt).
