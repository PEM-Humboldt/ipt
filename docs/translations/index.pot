"The DwC-A format and the specific profile described here represent an "
"internationally recognized and ratified data exchange format for sharing "
"taxonomic data. All data exchange standards must strike a balance between "
"the technical scope and capacity on one hand, and social acceptance and "
"uptake on the other. Simple solutions sacrifice coverage and complexity in "
"favour of ease-of-use. Highly complex formats provide more complete "
"solutions for representing any type of data but at the expense of simplicity "
"and require supporting software and expertise. The Darwin Core Archive "
"format represents an intermediate position between the two ends of this "
"spectrum. It focuses on the key elements of taxonomic checklists and enables "
"an enriched set of data types to be linked to this core structure. The data "
"contained in an archive can be readily understood and used by many "
"biologists and data managers familiar with basic structured text files. By "
"providing an international standard that is relatively easy to produce and "
"consume, and that supports many of the key elements that compose a taxonomic "
"data resource, GBIF hopes to provide the creators and managers of checklists "
"with a standardized approach to sharing their data and promote common "
"approaches to the subsequent citation and recognition of their work. A "
"standard format also increases relevance and utility."

#.  By providing an international standard that is relatively easy to produce and consume, and that supports many of the key elements that compose a sampling-event data resource, GBIF hopes to provide the creators and managers of sampling-event data with a standardized approach to sharing their data and promote common approaches to the subsequent citation and recognition of their work. The specific degree of coverage depends very much on the individual resource.

"The DwC-A format and the specific profile described here represent an "
"internationally recognized and ratified data exchange format for sharing "
"sampling-event data. All data exchange standards must strike a balance "
"between the technical scope and capacity on one hand, and social acceptance "
"and uptake on the other. Simple solutions sacrifice coverage and complexity "
"in favour of ease-of-use. Highly complex formats provide more complete "
"solutions for representing any type of data but at the expense of simplicity "
"and require supporting software and expertise. The Darwin Core Archive "
"format represents an intermediate position between the two ends of this "
"spectrum. It focuses on the key elements of sampling-event data and enables "
"an enriched set of data types to be linked to this core structure. The data "
"contained in an archive can be readily understood and used by many "
"ecologists and data managers familiar with basic structured text files. With "
"this international standard, GBIF hopes to facilitate sampling-event data "
"sharing and promote common approaches to cite and recognize the work of the "
"community creating and handling sampling-event data.  A standard format also "
"increases relevance and utility."

"| Description\n"
"\n"
"| 1. Creators\n"
"| One or more individuals, groups, or institutions responsible for the "
"creation of the dataset. All contributors to the dataset should be listed - "
"see https://www.force11.org/datacitation#JDCP2[data citation principle "
"2]. Creators should be aware, however, that the full list can be truncated "
"by the Journal during typesetting (e.g. According to "
"http://www.nature.com/sdata/for-authors/submission-guidelines#references[Nature’s "
"guidelines] they will truncate at 6 creators). Creators should be listed "
"last name first, followed by initials of given names. Creators are listed "
"according the importance of the role they played in the creation of the "
"dataset, with the most important creator appearing first. Multiple creators "
"are separated by commas.\n"
"\n"
"| 2. PublicationYear\n"
"| Year the dataset version was published/made publicly available.\n"
"\n"
"| 3. Title\n"
"| Title of the dataset. Only the first word of the title should have an "
"initial capital and the title should be written exactly as it appears in the "
"work cited, ending with a full stop.\n"
"\n"
"| 4. Version\n"
"| Dataset version. A new version number gets assigned by the IPT each time "
"the dataset gets published. The version should be written “Version "
"major_version.minor_version”. The version number enables “identification of, "
"access to, and verification of the specific data that support a claim” - see "
"https://www.force11.org/datacitation#JDCP7[data citation principle 7].\n"
"\n"
"| 5. Publisher\n"
"| Institution that published (owns) the dataset. In order to still give "
"credit to the repository hosting the data, the repository name could be "
"listed under creators.\n"
"\n"
"| 6. ResourceType\n"
"| Type of resource published. A description of the type of resource "
"constructed using the ResourceTypeGeneral/ResourceType pair: "
"ResourceTypeGeneral will always be equal to “Dataset”, and the ResourceType "
"is a single term specifying the specific type of dataset, "
"e.g. \"Occurrence\" or \"Checklist\".\n"
"\n"
"| 7. Identifier\n"
"| The DOI (digital object identifier) handle that resolves to the online "
"dataset. If a DOI is lacking, a link to the online IPT dataset page will be "
"used instead. A DOI is highly preferred, since the DOI guarantees persistent "
"access, whereas the IPT URL can change. For citation purposes, DataCite "
"recommends that DOIs are displayed as linkable, permanent URLs.\n"

"Darwin Core Archive (DwC-A) is a biodiversity informatics data standard that "
"makes use of the Darwin Core terms to produce a single, self contained "
"dataset for sharing species-level (taxonomic), species-occurrence data, and "
"sampling-event data. An archive is a set of text files, in standard comma- "
"or tab-delimited format, with a simple descriptor file (called *meta.xml*) "
"to inform others how the files are organized. The format is defined in the "
"https://dwc.tdwg.org/text/[Darwin Core Text Guidelines]. *It is the "

"in the core file; in this way, many extension records can exist for each "

"If sampling-event data, occurrence data or checklist data are being "

"a few metadata documents are needed, it might be easiest to generate them "
"manually, for example by modifying a sample document. Below is a description "
